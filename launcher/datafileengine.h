  The purpose of this class is to make the eviltemple resource system accessible through QFile.

  file exists on the disk, the normal FS handler is used instead. If the file does not exist,
  it is checked whether the file or directory exist in one of the registered archives.
  If that is the case, a handler that accesses the file in the ZIP file is used instead.
